# BluePillUsbDebugPrototyping
GDB debugging and firmware upload of STM32F103C8T6 via USB.
- Bootloader represented itself as WinUSB device. No Windows drivers needed. 
- Simple test GDB server for windows
- Simple demo application.

This is proof of concept only project. It is really works. You can bulid and run GdbServer, STM32 bootloader and simple firmware. But this is not a real debugging system. This is PROTOTYPING of onchip debugging of arm core. Flash size ~8K (16K reserved) Ram size 4K This project allows debug stm32f103c8t6 via USB without SWD, but with GDB. Bootloader supports upload firmware, breakpoints, stepping (but only on Thread mode not in Handlers). I know how to make debugging inside hanlders, but I think there is a good idea to make new project to make it.
