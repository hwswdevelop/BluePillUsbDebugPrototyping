# BluePillUsbDebugPrototyping
Bootloader for bluepill board (stm32f103c8t6) This is PROTOTYPING of onchip debugging of arm core. Flash size ~8K (16K reserved) Ram size 4K This project allows debug stm32f103c8t6 via USB. Bootloader supports upload firmware Bootloader supports breakpoint, stepping (but only on Thread not in Handlers) I know how to debug inside hanlders, but I think there is a good idea to make new project to do it.
